# Description of the hack
Description: >
    According to Tokenlon, the first attack targeted Uniswap at 8 p.m. EDT Friday using an exploit that targeted ERC777, an underlying technology on the Ethereum blockchain to perform a “reentrancy” attack. That attack exploits a function that makes an external call to another untrusted contract before it resolves any effects, allowing an attacker to take over control flow of the smart contract.
